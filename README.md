# Sign-language-recoginition-system
This project is an early-stage prototype of a sign language recognition system that detects and classifies hand gestures representing the letters A, B, and C in American Sign Language (ASL). It uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to interpret hand gestures from live video input and map them to their corresponding letters.
